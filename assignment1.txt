Connecting the ICE Programmer:

See chapter 3.2: Connecting to a JTAG target in the Atmel ICE manual (atmel-ice.pdf)

Table 3-1 describes which connectors of the mini-squid cable to connect where to the microcontroller.
The "Name" column is the pin name that you can find in Figure 1 in the atmega162 datasheet.
The "AVR port pin" is the white label wrapped around the cable connector.
